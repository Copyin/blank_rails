== README

This project is intended to be used as a clean playground in which you can debug and fix problems without fear of interference with anything else that might be in the Rails project. 

As you evolve it keep it in sync with the Rails rig that we're running on Copyin. Branch off individual experiments and endevour to keep the main branch clean of peripherals and noise (otherwise it defeats the purpose of the repo)
